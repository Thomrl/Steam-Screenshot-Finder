# Steam-Screenshot-Finder
Goes through steams userdata folder and looks for image files

# Good info if using the script

It is currently set to steam/userdata2 - So you either have to make a copy of userdata and name it userdata2 or change the code so it's set to userdata. 

I just chose userdata2 so it doesnt mess with anything original.
